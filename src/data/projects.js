      "In collaboration with Claudia Chaves Villarreal, a Ph.D. Candidate and her organization Biogas Pococi, we are working to implement Biodigestor tanks and micro controlling systems. She has already implemented this system for 38 families! The Biodigestor provides clean fuel without the emission of harmful particulates that has had detrimental impacts on the health of rural inhabitants. The Biodigestor also provides a source of fertilizer for farmers to use.",

      "In collaboration with a Civil Developer in Tanzania and the professional chapter of E.W.B in L.A. We are looking to install a micro controlled solar water pump system for a school, of 400+, in Tanzania. Currently students have to make themselves down a treacherous path of around 300 meters. This takes time out of their studies and puts their health and safety at risk!",

    description:
      "Water is one of the most imperative substances to life. With an ever increasing population, there will need to be more sources of water to be treated and tested. This however is not so easy in developing countries, as time and resources may be scarce. That is why a need for a water quality and filtration system that is affordable and easily implemented is needed.",
